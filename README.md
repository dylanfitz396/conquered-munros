This is a simple Next JS app set up to allow me to play around a bit with Next JS, Typescript and Tailwind using a free to use [fruityvice API](https://www.fruityvice.com/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/home](http://localhost:3000/home) with your browser to see the result.

## CORS Issues
If you are getting CORS issues when trying to hit the api, please add [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) and toggle it to "On". This should resolve the CORS issue for you.
